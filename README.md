# ImageToLockscreen

Resize images to fit Windows lockscreen. This tool will attempt to resize the canvas while preserving the actual image size, but will resize the image as a last attempt.

When selecting images to use as Windows lockscreen, if the image does not have the correct aspect ratio, the image will be rendered zoomed in to fill the entire area of the screen.
